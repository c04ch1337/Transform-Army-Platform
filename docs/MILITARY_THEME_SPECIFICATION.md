└────────────┘     └──────────┘   └──────────┘
```

#### Coordination Protocols

**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**:

1. **Mission Assignment**: Command assigns mission to squad
2. **Squad Planning**: Squad leader breaks down into fire team tasks
3. **Execution**: Fire teams execute simultaneously with checkpoints
4. **Reporting**: Fire teams report to squad leader → Platoon → Battalion
5. **Quality Gate**: QA Auditor validates before mission complete
6. **After-Action Review (AAR)**: Squad debriefs lessons learned

**Escalation Paths**:

```
Issue Severity → Escalation Level

P4 (Low)       → Squad Leader handles
P3 (Medium)    → Platoon Sergeant reviews
P2 (High)      → Platoon Leader alerted
P1 (Critical)  → Battalion Command notified + Immediate response
```

### Cross-Squad Operations (Joint Task Force)

When missions require multiple squads:

**Joint Task Force (JTF) Protocol**:
1. Battalion designates JTF Commander (senior squad leader)
2. Contributing squads assign liaisons
3. Unified command structure established
4. Shared communication channel created
5. Joint after-action report filed

**Example JTF**: Complex customer issue requiring sales context + support resolution + ops monitoring

**Primary Font (UI Text)**
```css
font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
```
- **Usage**: All body text, buttons, labels, headings
- **Rationale**: Modern, highly readable, professional

**Tactical Font (Headings - Optional)**
```css
font-family: 'Rajdhani', 'Orbitron', sans-serif;
```
- **Usage**: Major headings, dashboard titles, call signs
- **Rationale**: Military-tech aesthetic without being heavy
- **License**: Open Font License (free)
- **Alternative**: Use Inter Bold if keeping single font family

#### Font Scale & Usage

**Headings**
```css
h1: 2.5rem (40px), font-weight: 700, letter-spacing: -0.02em
h2: 2rem (32px), font-weight: 600, letter-spacing: -0.01em
h3: 1.5rem (24px), font-weight: 600, letter-spacing: 0
h4: 1.25rem (20px), font-weight: 600, letter-spacing: 0

tactical-display: 3rem (48px), font-weight: 700, font-family: tactical
tactical-heading: 1.5rem (24px), font-weight: 600, font-family: tactical
```

#### Typography Guidelines

**Case Usage**:
- **Sentence case**: Body text, descriptions, longer content
- **Title Case**: Major headings, page titles, agent names
- **UPPERCASE**: Labels, status badges, military ranks, call signs
- **lowercase**: Technical data, timestamps in some contexts

**Letter Spacing**:
- Headings: Slightly tighter (-0.02em to -0.01em) for modern look
- Body: Normal (0)
- Small Text: Slightly wider (0.01em to 0.02em) for readability
- UPPERCASE: Wider (0.05em to 0.1em) for military aesthetic

### Layout & Spacing

#### Spacing Scale (Based on 8px Grid)

```css
--space-0: 0px
--space-1: 4px    /* 0.25rem */
--space-2: 8px    /* 0.5rem */
--space-3: 12px   /* 0.75rem */
--space-4: 16px   /* 1rem */
--space-5: 20px   /* 1.25rem */
--space-6: 24px   /* 1.5rem */
--space-8: 32px   /* 2rem */
--space-10: 40px  /* 2.5rem */
--space-12: 48px  /* 3rem */
--space-16: 64px  /* 4rem */
--space-20: 80px  /* 5rem */
--space-24: 96px  /* 6rem */
```

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Micro spacing (1-2): Between icon and text, badge padding
- Small spacing (3-4): Component internal padding, gap between elements
- Medium spacing (5-6): Component external margin, section padding
- Large spacing (8-12): Section separation, page margins
- XL spacing (16-24): Major layout divisions

#### Border Radius

```css
--radius-none: 0px           /* Sharp tactical edges */
--radius-sm: 2px             /* Subtle rounding */
--radius-md: 4px             /* Standard components */
--radius-lg: 6px             /* Cards, panels */
--radius-xl: 8px             /* Large containers */
--radius-2xl: 12px           /* Modals */
--radius-full: 9999px        /* Pills, badges */
--radius-hexagon: polygon()  /* Hexagonal badges */
```

**Usage**:
- Prefer sharp edges (`0px` or `2px`) for tactical aesthetic
- Use `4px` for most interactive elements
- Reserve `6px+` for elevated surfaces
- Hexagonal shapes for badges and specialty indicators

#### Shadows & Elevation

**Shadow System** (Use sparingly with tactical theme):

```css
--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)
--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)
--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)

/* Tactical Glow Effects */
--glow-green: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5)
--glow-blue: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 217, 255, 0.5)
--glow-gold: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 184, 0, 0.5)
--glow-red: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)
```

**Usage**:
- Minimal shadows for flat tactical aesthetic
- Use glows for active/focused states
- Terminal-style scanlines for special effects
- Stronger shadows only for modals and dropdowns

### Iconography

#### Icon Library

**Primary**: [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) - Clean, modern, tactical-appropriate

**Tactical Icon Mappings**:

| Concept | Icon Name | Usage Context |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Agent/Operator | `User` / `UserCircle` | Agent avatars |
| Squad/Team | `Users` | Team view |
| Mission/Operation | `Target` / `Crosshair` | Mission status |
| Intelligence | `Eye` / `Search` / `Radar` | Research, recon |
| Communications | `Radio` / `MessageSquare` | Messaging, alerts |
| Monitoring | `Activity` / `BarChart` | Dashboards, metrics |
| Security | `Shield` / `Lock` | Security, permissions |
| Success | `CheckCircle` / `Trophy` | Completed missions |
| Warning | `AlertTriangle` / `AlertCircle` | Warnings |
| Error/Failure | `XCircle` / `AlertOctagon` | Errors, failures |
| Settings | `Settings` / `Sliders` | Configuration |
| Deploy | `Rocket` / `PlayCircle` | Deployment actions |
| Status | `Zap` / `Signal` | Live status |
| Workflows | `GitBranch` / `GitMerge` | Process flows |

| Satellite | `Satellite` | System overview |
| Documents | `FileText` / `Files` | Documentation |
| Time | `Clock` / `Calendar` | Scheduling |
| Location | `MapPin` / `Navigation` | Geographic data |

#### Custom Icons Needed

For unique military/tactical concepts not in Lucide:

1. **Rank Insignias** - Create SVG chevrons, bars, stars
2. **MOS Badges** - Hexagonal specialty badges
3. **Squad Symbols** - Alpha, Bravo, Charlie designators
4. **Tactical Patterns** - Grid overlays, scanlines
5. **Command Structure** - Organizational chart icons

**Creation Guidelines**:
- 24x24px base size (scalable SVG)
- 2px stroke width for consistency with Lucide
- Tactical color palette
- Export as SVG with no fills (use currentColor for flexibility)

```

#### Tactical Grid Pattern

**Grid Overlay** (Subtle background):
```css
background-image: 
  linear-gradient(rgba(74, 124, 89, 0.03) 1px, transparent 1px),
  linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(74, 124, 89, 0.03) 1px, transparent 1px);
background-size: 20px 20px;
```

**Usage**: Apply to tactical areas, command center backgrounds

#### Scanline Effect

**Terminal-Style Scanlines** (Use sparingly):
```css
@keyframes scanline {
  0% { transform: translateY(-100%); }
  100% { transform: translateY(100%); }
}

.scanline-effect::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background: linear-gradient(transparent, rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.3), transparent);
  animation: scanline 3s linear infinite;
}
```

**Usage**: Critical status displays, live monitoring panels

#### Hexagonal Badge Component

**Structure**:
```tsx
<div className="hexagon-badge">
  <div className="hexagon-container">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 100 115" className="hexagon-shape">
      <polygon points="50,1 95,25 95,75 50,99 5,75 5,25" />
    </svg>
    <div className="hexagon-content">
      <div className="badge-icon">{icon}</div>
      <div className="badge-code">35L</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Usage**: Agent specialty badges, rank insignias, status indicators

#### Military Time Display

**Format**: `23:45:32Z` (24-hour with Zulu indicator)

```tsx
function MilitaryTime() {
  const time = new Date().toISOString().slice(11, 19) + 'Z';
  return <time className="military-time">{time}</time>;
}
```

**Usage**: All timestamps, clock displays, log entries

#### Status Badge Variants

**Mission Status Badges**:
```tsx
<Badge variant="operational">OPERATIONAL</Badge>    // Green

<Badge variant="p4">P4 - LOW</Badge>                // Gray
```

### Animation & Motion

#### Animation Principles

**Military Precision**:
- **Fast and decisive**: 200ms or less for most transitions
- **Purposeful**: Every animation serves a function
- **Restrained**: Avoid playful bounces or excessive movement
- **Tactical feedback**: Confirm actions sharply

#### Standard Transitions

```css
/* Default transition */
transition: all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);

/* Fade in/out */
transition: opacity 150ms ease-in-out;

/* Slide transitions */
transition: transform 200ms ease-out;

/* Color changes (status) */
transition: color 150ms ease, background-color 150ms ease;
```

#### Hover States

```css
/* Buttons and interactive elements */
.tactical-button {
  transition: all 200ms ease;
}

.tactical-button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: var(--glow-green);
}

.tactical-button:active {
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

#### Loading States

**Tactical Spinner** (Military-style):
```tsx
<div className="tactical-spinner">
  <div className="spinner-ring"></div>
  <span className="loading-text">DEPLOYING...</span>
</div>
```

**Skeleton Loaders**:
- Use tactical grid pattern in background
- Pulse effect with green highlight
- Sharp edges, no rounded corners

#### Notification Animations

**Toast Entrance** (Radio transmission style):
```css
@keyframes toast-enter {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(100%) scale(0.9);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0) scale(1);
  }
}

.toast {
  animation: toast-enter 300ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
}
```

### Responsive Design

#### Breakpoints

```css
--breakpoint-xs: 0px         /* Mobile portrait */
--breakpoint-sm: 640px       /* Mobile landscape */
--breakpoint-md: 768px       /* Tablet */
--breakpoint-lg: 1024px      /* Desktop */
--breakpoint-xl: 1280px      /* Large desktop */
--breakpoint-2xl: 1536px     /* XL desktop */
```

#### Mobile Adaptations

**Command Center → Mobile View**:
- Sidebar collapses to hamburger menu
- SITREP becomes accordion/collapsible
- Agent grid switches to list view
- Bottom navigation for key actions
- Simplified tactical patterns (performance)

**Touch Targets**:
- Minimum 44x44px for tap targets
- Increased spacing on mobile
- Larger buttons and badges
