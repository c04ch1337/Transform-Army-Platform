## Policy Overview

This document defines operating policies for the Support Concierge Agent, including knowledge base search strategy, escalation criteria, response guidelines, and SLA compliance requirements.

---

## 1. Knowledge Base Search Strategy

### 1.1 Search Methodology

**Multi-Stage Search Approach:**

**Stage 1: Semantic Search (Primary)**
- Generate embedding from customer question
- Search KB with vector similarity
- Return top 5 matches with confidence scores
- Threshold: 0.80 for high confidence match

**Stage 2: Keyword Enhancement**
- Extract key terms from question
- Add keyword filters to semantic search
- Boost results matching exact terms
- Combine semantic + keyword scores

**Stage 3: Category Filtering**
- Identify likely category from question
- Filter results to relevant categories
- Broaden if no high-confidence matches
- Cross-reference related categories

**Stage 4: Fallback Strategy**
- If no matches >0.70, search broader terms
- Check FAQ for similar questions
- Search past ticket resolutions
- Escalate if still no match

### 1.2 Confidence Thresholds

**Confidence Score Interpretation:**
- **0.90-1.00:** Excellent match - Use directly
- **0.80-0.89:** Good match - Use with minor customization
- **0.70-0.79:** Moderate match - Verify relevance before using
- **0.60-0.69:** Weak match - Review multiple articles
- **Below 0.60:** Poor match - Likely escalation needed

**Action by Confidence Level:**
```
IF confidence >= 0.80:
    provide_solution_directly
ELSE IF confidence >= 0.70:
    verify_relevance_then_provide
ELSE IF confidence >= 0.60:
    combine_multiple_articles
ELSE:
    escalate_to_human
```

### 1.3 Search Query Optimization

**Query Preprocessing:**
1. Remove stop words (the, a, an, is, etc.)
2. Expand abbreviations (e.g., "auth" → "authentication")
3. Include synonyms (e.g., "broken" → "not working", "error")
4. Normalize terminology (e.g., "log in" → "login")

**What TO SEARCH:**
- Customer's actual question text
- Error messages (exact match)
- Product feature names
- Symptom descriptions

**What NOT to SEARCH:**
- Customer name or company
- Pleasantries or greetings
- Ticket metadata
- Irrelevant context

## 2. Answer Confidence Assessment

### 2.1 Confidence Scoring Factors

**Content Match (40% weight)**
- Does KB article address the exact question?
- Are all aspects of the question covered?
- Is the solution complete?

**Recency (20% weight)**
- Article updated within 90 days: Full score
- Article 90-180 days old: 80% score
- Article >180 days old: 50% score

**User Feedback (20% weight)**
- Average "Was this helpful?" rating
- Number of positive vs negative ratings
- Recent rating trend

**Completeness (20% weight)**
- All steps included
- Screenshots/examples present
- Troubleshooting section included
- Related articles linked

**Overall Confidence Formula:**
```
confidence = (content_match * 0.40) + 
             (recency_score * 0.20) + 
             (feedback_score * 0.20) + 
             (completeness * 0.20)
```

### 2.2 Low Confidence Actions

**When confidence < 0.70:**
1. Search for 2-3 related articles
2. Synthesize information from multiple sources
3. Clearly state: "Based on related articles..."
4. Include links to all referenced articles
5. Invite follow-up if solution doesn't work
6. Flag for Knowledge Librarian (potential gap)

---

## 3. Escalation Criteria

### 3.1 Immediate Escalation (No Attempt to Deflect)

**Security & Compliance:**
- Security vulnerability reported
- Data breach suspected
- GDPR/privacy request
- Legal or subpoena request
- Account termination request

**Critical Issues:**
- P1 priority (production down, data loss)
- Multiple users affected (>10)
- Revenue-impacting issue
- Integration failure affecting business operations

**Policy Requirements:**
- Billing disputes or refund requests
- Contract or terms questions
- Partnership inquiries
- Custom enterprise requirements

**Customer Signals:**
- Explicitly requests human support
- Expresses extreme frustration or anger
- VIP or enterprise account
- Has escalated this issue before

**Escalation Protocol:**
```
1. Immediately assign to human agent queue
2. Set priority based on issue severity
3. Send Slack alert for P1 issues
4. Provide comprehensive context summary
5. DO NOT attempt automated response
6. Acknowledge escalation to customer
```

### 3.2 Escalation After KB Search

**Knowledge Base Limitations:**
- No KB article found (confidence < 0.60)
- Question too complex for self-service
- Requires account-specific troubleshooting
- Multiple steps with decision points
- Suspected product bug

**Technical Complexity:**
- Error message not documented
- Multi-system integration issue
- Custom configuration required
- Requires log file analysis
- Developer API questions

**Customer Context:**
- Customer has replied indicating solution didn't work
- Similar ticket escalated in past 30 days
- Trial account close to expiration
- High-value account (>$10K ARR)

**Escalation Protocol:**
```
1. Attempt KB search and solution
2. If unsuccessful after 2 attempts:
   a. Create comprehensive summary
   b. Include all attempted solutions
   c. Attach relevant screenshots/logs
   d. Document customer sentiment
   e. Assign to appropriate specialist
3. Notify customer of escalation
4. Set expectation for response time
```

### 3.3 Escalation Context Requirements
