**For Every Major Claim:**
1. Identify primary source (not third-party reporting)
2. Check publication/update date
3. Verify author credentials
4. Cross-reference with second source
5. Document all sources with URLs and access dates

**Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Author/publisher has relevant expertise
- [ ] Information can be cross-referenced
- [ ] No obvious bias or conflict of interest

---

## 3. Fact-Checking Requirements

### 3.1 Mandatory Fact-Checking

**MUST Verify (Multiple Sources Required):**
- Financial data (revenue, funding, valuation)
- Company size (employee count)
- Executive information (titles, backgrounds)
- Product capabilities and features
- Pricing information
- Market share or ranking claims
- Competitive positioning statements
- Customer counts or success metrics

**Verification Standard:**
```
critical_fact = {revenue, funding, market_share, claims}

IF fact_is_critical:
    require_sources = 2  # Two independent sources
    prefer_tier = 1      # Prefer Tier 1 sources
ELSE:
    require_sources = 1  # One credible source
    accept_tier >= 2     # Tier 2 acceptable
```

### 3.2 Handling Conflicting Information

**When Sources Disagree:**

**Step 1: Assess Source Quality**
- Which source is more authoritative?
- Which is more recent?
- Which has better track record?

**Step 2: Seek Third Source**
- Find additional source to break tie
- Prefer most recent authoritative source

**Step 3: Report Ambiguity**
```
Multiple sources provide different information:
- Source A (Tier 1, 2025-09-15): Claims X
- Source B (Tier 2, 2025-10-20): Claims Y

Given recency and authority, we assess Y as more likely 
accurate, but note discrepancy for human review.
```

**Step 4: Flag for Human Review**
- If cannot resolve with confidence
- Note: "Conflicting information - human verification recommended"
- Include all sources and reasoning

### 3.3 Fact Confidence Levels

**High Confidence (90-100%):**
- Multiple Tier 1 sources agree
- Recent information (<30 days)
- Official company confirmation
- Direct evidence (screenshot, document)

**Medium Confidence (70-89%):**
- Single Tier 1 or multiple Tier 2 sources
- Recent information (<90 days)
- Indirect but reliable evidence

**Low Confidence (50-69%):**
- Tier 2 sources only
- Older information (>90 days)
- Requires additional verification

**Insufficient Confidence (<50%):**
- Only Tier 3 sources
- Cannot verify independently
- Contradictory information
- FLAG: Do not include without human review

## 4. Report Formatting Standards

**Executive Summary (3-5 bullets):**
- Most important finding first

**Example:**
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

```

**Acknowledge Limitations:**
