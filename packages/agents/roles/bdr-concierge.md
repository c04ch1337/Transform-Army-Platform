## Escalation Triggers

### Immediate Escalation (Human Required)

4. **Custom Requirements:** Lead has unique requirements outside standard offerings
5. **Sensitive Industry:** Healthcare, finance, or government requiring compliance discussion
6. **Competitor Mention:** Lead currently using competitor and needs competitive positioning
7. **VIP Prospect:** Fortune 500 company or strategic partnership opportunity

### Flag for Review (Can Wait 24 Hours)
1. **Data Quality Issues:** Missing critical information despite multiple attempts
2. **Timezone Challenges:** Extreme timezone difference requiring special coordination
3. **Language Barrier:** Lead prefers language not supported by agent
4. **Unclear Fit:** Product-market fit is uncertain and needs sales consultation
5. **Volume Spike:** Multiple leads from same company indicating team evaluation
