## Decision Logic

### Qualification Decision Tree

```
IF email_invalid:
    RETURN "Cannot qualify - invalid email"

IF crm_duplicate_found:
    UPDATE existing_record
    NOTE "Return visit"
    CONTINUE qualification

IF company_size < 50:
    budget_score = MAX 15 points
ELIF company_size >= 50 AND < 500:
    budget_score = UP TO 25 points
ELSE:
    budget_score = UP TO 30 points

IF title IN ["CEO", "CTO", "CFO", "VP"]:
    authority_score = 20-25 points
ELIF title IN ["Director", "Manager"]:
    authority_score = 10-19 points
ELSE:
    authority_score = 0-9 points

IF pain_point_clearly_stated AND product_fit_strong:
    need_score = 25-30 points
ELIF general_interest:
    need_score = 15-24 points
ELSE:
    need_score = 0-14 points

IF timeline_within_30_days:
    timeline_score = 12-15 points
ELIF timeline_within_90_days:
    timeline_score = 6-11 points
ELSE:
    timeline_score = 0-5 points

total_score = budget + authority + need + timeline

IF total_score >= 70:
    QUALIFY
    BOOK_MEETING
ELSE:
    ADD_TO_NURTURE
```

### Escalation Decision Tree

```
IF (deal_size_estimate > $50K OR 
    company_size > 1000 OR 
    c_level_contact):
    ESCALATE_TO sales_manager
    REASON "High-value opportunity"

IF (competitor_mentioned OR 
    active_evaluation_in_progress):
    ESCALATE_TO sales_manager
    REASON "Competitive situation"

IF (custom_requirements OR 
    technical_questions_beyond_scope):
    ESCALATE_TO solutions_engineer
    REASON "Technical complexity"

IF (industry IN ["healthcare", "finance", "government"]):
    FLAG_FOR compliance_review
    PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION
```

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Qualified Lead

**Input:**
```
Email: sarah.johnson@techcorp.com
Name: Sarah Johnson
Company: TechCorp
Message: "Hi, I'm the VP of Sales at TechCorp (200 employees). 
We're looking to replace our current CRM system within the next 
60 days. Our budget is $75K annually. Can we schedule a demo?"
```

**Agent Reasoning:**
```
1. Search CRM: No existing contact found
2. Extract BANT:
   - Budget: $75K mentioned explicitly
   - Authority: VP of Sales (decision maker)
   - Need: CRM replacement (clear pain point)
   - Timeline: 60 days (urgent)
3. Company research: TechCorp, 200 employees, B2B SaaS
4. Score calculation:
   - Budget: 28/30 (explicit budget, good size)
   - Authority: 25/25 (VP, clear decision authority)
   - Need: 28/30 (replacing existing, clear requirements)
   - Timeline: 14/15 (within 60 days, active project)
   - TOTAL: 95/100
5. Decision: QUALIFIED - Book demo call (60 min)
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "qualified": true,
  "score": 95,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "next_action": "demo_booked",
  "meeting": {
    "type": "demo",
    "duration": 60,
    "date": "2025-11-05T14:00:00Z",
    "sales_rep": "John Smith"
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Unqualified Lead

**Input:**
```
Email: student@university.edu
Name: Mike Chen
Company: Personal
Message: "I'm interested in learning about your product for 
a school project. Can you send me some information?"
```

**Agent Reasoning:**
```
1. Search CRM: No existing contact
2. Extract BANT:
   - Budget: None mentioned, .edu email (student)
   - Authority: None (personal use)
   - Need: Academic project (not business use case)
   - Timeline: Unclear
3. Score calculation:
   - Budget: 0/30 (no budget, student)
   - Authority: 0/25 (not business decision maker)
   - Need: 5/30 (not our target use case)
   - Timeline: 0/15 (no business timeline)
   - TOTAL: 5/100
4. Decision: UNQUALIFIED - Send educational resources
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "qualified": false,
  "score": 5,
  "reason": "Not target customer (student, no business use case)",
  "next_action": "send_resources",
  "email_template": "educational_resources"
}
```

## Error Handling

**CRM Connection Failure:**
```
1. Retry operation once after 5 seconds
2. If still failing, store lead data in fallback queue
3. Alert operations team
4. Send manual response to lead:
   "Thank you for your interest. We're experiencing a 
   temporary system issue. A team member will contact 
   you within 1 hour."
```

**Invalid Email Format:**
```
1. Validate email using RFC 5322 regex
2. If invalid, request corrected email:
   "The email address provided appears to be invalid. 
   Could you please verify: {{email}}?"
3. Do not proceed with qualification until valid
```

**Ambiguous BANT Information:**
```
1. Identify missing critical information
2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - Budget: "What budget range have you allocated?"
   - Authority: "Who else will be involved in this decision?"
   - Timeline: "When do you need this implemented by?"
3. Do not assume or guess - get explicit information
```
