Buckle up. You asked for a hard-nosed, multi-angle plan to launch a white-label **Business Transformation** company using **Relevance AI** as your starter backend “agent force,” then grow into your own platform. Here’s the strategy—first as a debate between three very different execs, then the consensus blueprint with concrete use cases, agent org chart (and how it evolves), a phased build plan, a business plan, a technical design plan, and a **Cursor + Kilo Code** architecting prompt.

---

# The Executive Triangulation

**1) The CFO (Risk Hawk & Unit-Economics first)**

* Use Relevance’s **Actions + Vendor Credits** model to meter work and model costs; encourage **BYO LLM keys** for advanced clients to control spend and margin. Credits roll over and model costs pass through without markup, which simplifies pricing ladders and cashflow. ([Relevance AI][1])
* Start with narrow, high-ROI playbooks (lead qual, support triage, ops digests) and expand only when KPIs are met.
* Gate multi-agent complexity behind proof points; instrument everything.

**2) The CPO (Product Vision & Velocity)**

* Stand on Relevance’s primitives: **Agents** + **Tools** + **Knowledge (RAG)** + **Workforce (multi-agent)** + **Embeds/Sharing** to ship value in week one. Then iterate. ([Relevance AI][2])
* Lean on the new **deterministic variable passing** in Workforce for reliability as you scale multi-agent handoffs. ([Relevance AI][3])
* Package **templates** per use case and clone for new customers; keep tools vendor-agnostic.

**3) The COO/CTO (Ops Realist & Future-Proofer)**

* Phase 1: Relevance-native deployments for speed.
* Phase 2: Add a thin “adapter” service so your agents call *your* stable contracts; this de-risks later migration.
* Phase 3: Gradually replace orchestration with your own LangGraph/FastAPI platform while keeping Relevance for distribution (embeds, share links) until full cutover. (Relevance is built for teams to compose multi-agent systems and expose them cleanly.) ([Relevance AI][4])

**Consensus:** Launch now on Relevance; meter cost with Actions/Credits; templatize use cases; add an adapter for portability; then productize your own stack when revenue justifies it.

# What you’ll sell (starter → pro → enterprise)

## Core use cases (week-1 friendly, demonstrably valuable)

* **Inbound Lead Concierge (Sales Ops):** qualify with structured criteria, enrich CRM, book meetings, push notes to CRM. Agents + Tools + Embeds cover this quickly. ([Relevance AI][2])
* **Support Triage & Deflection:** ground on your client’s KB with **Knowledge/RAG**, deflect Tier-0/1, escalate with perfect summaries. ([Relevance AI][5])
* **Research & Briefs (RevOps/Marketing):** competitor/SEO briefs, conference scanning, weekly intel digest via tools and bulk runs. ([Relevance AI][6])
* **Ops Automations:** nightly SLA checks, task hygiene, weekly roll-ups to Slack/Email.
* **MRP-style multi-integration flows:** cloneable agents that work across common apps (Notion, HubSpot, Google, Salesforce, etc.). ([Relevance AI][7])

## Expansion use cases (after first wins)

* **Account Health AI:** watch ticket volume, NPS comments, renewal dates; flag risks, draft save-motions.
* **PS/Agency Co-Pilot:** SOW drafting, timesheet nudges, risk/issue tracker updates.
* **CX Content Ops:** KB gap detection, doc refresh proposals, tone QA.

# Your AI “Force Structure” (titles → evolution)

## Phase A — Ground Floor (4–6 agents)

* **BDR/SDR Concierge** — qualifies, enriches, books.
* **Support Concierge** — deflects or escalates with context.
* **Research Recon** — compiles briefs and digests.
* **Ops Sapper** — hygiene checks, SLAs, weekly reports.
* **Knowledge Librarian** — ingests docs, tags, validates retrieval results.
* **QA Auditor** — rubric-scores outputs, finds failure patterns.

## Phase B — Squads & Leads (multi-agent)

* **Sales Squad** (BDR + Research Recon + QA Auditor)
* **Support Squad** (Concierge + Librarian + QA)
* **Ops Squad** (Sapper + Data Wrangler + Calendar/Email tooler)
* **Squad Leads** coordinate variable passing and approvals (use Workforce for deterministic handoffs). ([Relevance AI][3])

## Phase C — Manager Agents & Specialization

* **Workflow Commander** (routing/priority + SLA)
* **Policy Officer** (compliance/policy gate)
* **Cost Sentinel** (tracks Actions/Credits vs value) ([Relevance AI][8])
* **Integration Quartermaster** (manages per-client tool keys, share links, embeds) ([Relevance AI][9])

# How to start (and then grow)

## Day 0–7: “Land & Prove”

1. Create your org and first project; build **4 base agents** (above). Use Relevance **Tools** for CRM/helpdesk/email/calendar and a **Knowledge** table for each client. ([Relevance AI][6])
2. Expose with **Chat Embed** on a demo site; share links for stakeholders. ([Relevance AI][10])
3. Meter usage with **Actions**; start with vendor models or BYO keys as needed. ([Relevance AI][8])

## Week 2–4: “Template & Sell”

1. Turn your best flows into **templates**; clone per client, connect their apps. ([Relevance AI][7])
2. Add **Workforce** patterns with deterministic variable passing for multi-agent reliability. ([Relevance AI][4])
3. Publish a simple pricing page tied to Actions/Credits; upsell with bundled playbooks. ([Relevance AI][8])

## Month 2–3: “Adapter & Scale”

1. Insert a thin API **adapter** (your domain contracts) between agents and third-party tools.
2. Start building your own orchestrator (LangGraph) behind the adapter while still using Relevance embeds/shares for distribution. ([Relevance AI][10])
3. Add QA/eval loops and operator dashboards.

## Month 4+: “Platform Lift-off”

* Offer on-prem/VPC for bigger clients; expand connector catalog; begin selective migration of critical flows to your platform while keeping Relevance for rapid prototyping and demos.

# Business Plan (condensed)

**Positioning:** “Agentic Business Transformation—results in weeks, not quarters.”
**ICP:** services firms (consulting, agencies, MSP), mid-market ops teams with multi-app sprawl.
**Value Story:** Replace brittle RPA and single-bot chat with **multi-agent teams** that deliver measurable outcomes. (This aligns with where the market is heading—enterprises are standardizing on “AI workforce” concepts.) ([Relevance AI][11])

**Packaging & Pricing:**

* **Starter:** 3 agents + 2 tools + 1 knowledge table + embed; X Actions/mo; Vendor Credits pooled; BYO keys allowed. ([Relevance AI][8])
* **Growth:** 6–10 agents + Workforce flows + more tools/knowledge; higher Actions; shared dashboards.
* **Enterprise:** unlimited agents, private projects, SSO, VPC/air-gapped options, custom connectors.

**Metrics/KPIs:** deflection rate, cycle time, cost per Action, revenue lift from qualified meetings, QA rubric scores.
**GTM:** 30-day paid pilots; case studies; “template gallery” demos; partner program for SIs/MSPs.

# Design Plan (on Relevance first, portable later)

**Relevance-Native Layer**

* **Agents** for each role; **Tools** for CRM/helpdesk/email/calendar; **Knowledge** tables per client with provenance. ([Relevance AI][2])
* **Workforce** for multi-agent handoffs with deterministic variable passing (reliability win). ([Relevance AI][4])
* **Embeds/Sharing** to expose outcomes fast (iframe chat + share links). ([Relevance AI][10])
* **Billing Alignment:** Actions as the operational meter; Vendor Credits for model costs; BYO supported. ([Relevance AI][8])

**Adapter (your “portability spine”)**

* REST endpoints: `create_ticket`, `book_meeting`, `push_crm_note`, `send_email`, `kb_search`.
* Contract-first JSON; vendors pluggable; logs + audit IDs.

**Own-Platform Roadmap**

* **Orchestration:** LangGraph state machines; approval gates; retries.
* **Persistence:** Postgres + vector DB; per-tenant namespaces.
* **Ops:** RBAC, usage metering, cost explorer, eval harness.
* **Distribution:** keep Relevance embeds during the transition; replace with your own widgets later.

# Cursor Prompt (drop this into a new Cursor chat)

```
You are Kilo Code, acting as Principal Architect for “Transform Army AI”.

Objectives:
1) Scaffold a monorepo for a white-label agentic transformation service that launches on Relevance AI and later ports to our own adapter/orchestrator.
2) Create contracts, adapters, and Relevance-facing assets to ship week-1 value.

Repo Layout:
- apps/web (Next.js operator console + client portal)
- apps/adapter (FastAPI; endpoints: create_ticket, book_meeting, push_crm_note, send_email, kb_search)
- apps/evals (QA rubrics + regression tasks)
- packages/agents (role prompts/policies for BDR, Support Concierge, Research Recon, Ops Sapper, Librarian, QA Auditor)
- packages/tools (provider wrappers; vendor-agnostic interfaces)
- packages/schema (Pydantic/Zod models; Action/Event/Tool envelopes)
- packages/prompt-pack (system prompts)
- infra/compose (docker-compose.dev.yml)
- .cursor/rules/base.rules.md and memory-bank/* (vision, architecture, contracts, prompts, ops runbooks)

Tasks:
1) Create schema models: Event, ToolInput, ToolResult (Python + TS), with tests.
2) Generate base prompts for 6 agents with explicit rubrics.
3) Implement FastAPI adapter with stub providers (Zendesk, HubSpot, Google Calendar, Gmail).
4) Prepare Relevance artifacts:
   - Agent definitions referencing our adapter endpoints via “Tools”.
   - Knowledge table templates with provenance fields.
   - Workforce plan templates with deterministic variable passing notes.
5) Build web console:
   - Runs stream, approvals, per-tenant config keys, usage dashboard (Actions/credits view).
6) Provide Makefile, .env.example, docker compose; ensure `make up` runs web:3000 and adapter:8000.
7) Add tests: happy-path flows for lead qual, support escalation, weekly ops digest.
8) Emit a README with: how to connect Relevance Agents to our adapter; how to embed chat on a client site; how to clone templates per tenant.

Guardrails:
- No secrets in code. .env only.
- Contract-first: write models and tests before provider logic.
- Keep adapters idempotent; include correlation IDs for audit.
- Prefer small, composable tools over monolithic ones.

Deliverables:
- Running dev stack (compose) + sample client template + Relevance setup checklist.
- Two demo agents wired to the adapter and a shareable embed snippet.
```

# Why this wins (market reality check)

* The industry is normalizing on **multi-agent “AI workforce”** platforms; Relevance provides a fast lane to ship credible, repeatable value now. ([Relevance AI][12])
* Their pricing shift makes it straight-forward to turn your services into metered SKUs while avoiding “model markup” optics. ([Relevance AI][8])
* You keep a clean path to your own platform by adding the adapter early, then migrating orchestration later—no dead ends.



When you’re ready, I can spin a tenant-ready template list (Agents, Tools, Knowledge tables, and Workforce flows) for your first three logos, and a baseline SLA/KPI sheet to track 10× improvements against—starting day one.
